    <h2>Why Every Business Needs a Website</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s digital age, having a website is no longer optional—it’s essential. 
      A website serves as the online face of your business, allowing potential customers 
      to find you anytime, anywhere. Without one, you risk losing opportunities to 
      competitors who are just a click away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A professional website builds trust, credibility, and brand awareness. 
      It gives your business a platform to showcase your products, services, 
      and values to a global audience. With features like contact forms, 
      e-commerce, and blogs, your website can also help you generate leads, 
      increase sales, and provide customer support 24/7.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you run a small local shop or a large enterprise, 
      your website acts as the hub of all your marketing activities. 
      Social media, ads, and email campaigns all direct people to one place: 
      your site. Without it, your business risks being invisible in today’s 
      competitive marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom line: If you want to stay relevant, grow your reach, and 
      succeed long-term, investing in a website is one of the smartest 
      decisions you can make for your business.
